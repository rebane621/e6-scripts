# e6-scripts

After updating most of my user scripts for e621 after the 2020 update, I thought I might as well share them.
To install a script you need Tempermonkey for Chrome or Greasemonkey for FF

# The scripts

## [Quick Search](https://github.com/rebane621/e6-scripts/raw/master/quick_search.user.js)

This adds a small post search bar on top of the page for all pages that do not have it

## [Thumbnail Enlarger](https://github.com/rebane621/e6-scripts/raw/master/thumnail_enlarger.user.js)

Whenever you see a post thumbnail you can hold shift and hover over it to. This will load the image into an overlay that fills most of the page.

## [User Levels](https://github.com/rebane621/e6-scripts/raw/master/user_levels.user.js)

For the competitive, a little fun script. Go to a user page and this script will calculate a 'Level' based on your stats. Little badges will appear next to the avatar or name, based on certain activities on the site.

### Don't forget to mention the script if you open an issue

PRs and Feedback welcome.
